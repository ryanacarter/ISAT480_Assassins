GAME CONCEPT:

	Inspired by the already popular game known as "Assassin", in which players attempt to
	eliminate other players using fake weapons and try to become the last surviving 
	player. Players often use tools such as spoons or toy guns. In this application, we 
	allow participants to play the game, with the original rules, while getting rid of 
	the need for physical weapons to eliminate other players from the game. Using
	Bluetooth connectivity to monitor players' proximity from one another, players can 
	use the "Kill" button in the application to eliminate the target once they get close
	enough.

FEATURES:
	
	1. Compatible with Android, Linux, OS X, and Windows 
	
	2. Designed using Kivy, which is an open source python library designed especially for
	the development of mobile applications.
	
	3. Bluetooth connectivity allows devices to communicate their proximity from one 
	another. It is essential for the functionality of this application. The app
	must require the user to initiate the device discoverable mode. The "BluetoothAdapter" 
	class allows the user to perform tasks such as initiating device discovery.
